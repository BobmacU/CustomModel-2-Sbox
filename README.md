## 🎯 What Is This?
A Blender script and A Blender scene file to work on along with VMDL and VAnimgraph set up with **Proportion Trick** to port custom models easily!
I forked the original script and added the following.

- Shapekey preservation from this [addon](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/apply-modifiers-with-shape-keys/)
- Custom models support as the original script only works best for S1 models. 
- Fixed citizen armature neck pose.
- And some random fixes.

Credits goes to [**Noztik**](https://github.com/Noztik/Source-to-Sbox-Playermodel-Converter/commits?author=Noztik) for the original files.
Thank you for checking this out! :)
